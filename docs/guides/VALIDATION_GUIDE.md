# Quick Reference Guide: Identifying Stream-Jacking vs Legitimate Content

## 🔴 HIGH CONFIDENCE SCAM INDICATORS

### Definite Red Flags (Multiple = Very High Confidence)
- ✅ **Celebrity impersonation** + crypto giveaway
- ✅ **"Send crypto to receive 2x back"** messaging
- ✅ **Fake live event** (e.g., "Elon Musk ETH Giveaway LIVE")
- ✅ **Crypto wallet addresses in description** + impersonation
- ✅ **Urgency language** ("Limited time!", "Only 1000 spots!", "Hurry!")
- ✅ **Suspicious shortened URLs** (bit.ly, t.co pointing to external sites)
- ✅ **Character substitution** (Tesl@ for Tesla, Mus1c for Music)
- ✅ **High views but disabled/restricted comments**
- ✅ **Old account suddenly posting crypto content**

### Common Scam Patterns
1. **Celebrity Crypto Giveaway**
   - Title: "Elon Musk Bitcoin Giveaway LIVE"
   - Description: Wallet address, "Send 0.1 BTC receive 1 BTC"
   - Actually: Looping fake video, no real live event

2. **Hijacked Channel**
   - Old gaming/music channel now posting crypto
   - Channel name changed to crypto-related
   - All old videos deleted or hidden
   - Recent crypto live streams only

3. **Fake Trading Signal Service**
   - Claims "100% accurate signals"
   - Urgent: "Join now to get signals"
   - Telegram/Discord link for "VIP group"
   - Often uses bit.ly links

4. **Impersonated Tech Event**
   - "SpaceX Bitcoin Event LIVE"
   - "Tesla Crypto Announcement"
   - Actually: Recycled old interview video
   - Description has wallet address or scam site

## 🟡 GRAY AREA - NEEDS CAREFUL REVIEW

### Borderline Cases
1. **Trading Signal Services (May be legitimate but sketchy)**
   - Look for: Transparency about paid services
   - Red flag: "Guaranteed profits", "Never lose"
   - Check: Do they have disclaimers? Terms of service?

2. **Crypto Promotion Channels**
   - Some are legitimate marketing
   - Red flags: Anonymous, urgent CTAs, unrealistic promises
   - Legitimate: Clear company info, proper disclosures

3. **News Aggregators**
   - Some restream legitimate content (gray area/copyright)
   - Not necessarily scams, but may violate ToS
   - Focus on: Are they adding scam elements?

### 2. **Video Content** (If still available)

### 4. **Engagement Patterns**

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFICIENT REVIEW

1. **Start with high-confidence cases** (clear scams and known legit channels)
2. **Batch similar types** (all news channels together, all giveaways together)
3. **Document patterns** - note what made identification easy or hard
4. **Take breaks** - Decision fatigue leads to inconsistent labeling
5. **When in doubt** - Label as "uncertain" rather than guessing
6. **Check if video still exists** - Many scam streams get taken down quickly

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- ❌ **Don't assume all crypto content is scam** - Legitimate education exists
- ❌ **Don't assume big channels are safe** - Accounts get hijacked
- ❌ **Don't judge by production quality alone** - Scammers steal professional content
- ❌ **Don't skip visiting the actual URL** - Context is crucial
- ❌ **Don't let risk score override your judgment** - It's a tool, not perfect

## 📊 EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION (Rough Estimate)

Based on initial patterns:
- **True Positives (Actual Scams)**: ~40-60%
- **False Positives (Legitimate)**: ~30-40%
- **Uncertain**: ~10-20%

If your distribution is very different, double-check your criteria for consistency.
